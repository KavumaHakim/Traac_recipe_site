                <ol>
                    <li>Brown the beef cubes slowly in a large pot with some oil over high heat, until they're nicely browned on all sides.</li>
                    <li>Add sliced onions, minced garlic, and chopped carrots to the pot; cook until the veggies are softened and fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Pour in some rich beef broth, a spoonful of tomato paste, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs; stir everything together to combine.</li>
                    <li>Let the stew simmer gently, covered, for 2-3 hours or until the beef is tender and falls apart easily.</li>
                    <li>Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste, then serve it hot, garnished with fresh herbs, if desired.</li>

                <h2>Pasta</h2>
                <img src="../Images/pasta.webp" alt="" width="400px" height="300px">
                <ol>
                    <li>To start, boil a large amount of salted water in a big pot, then add your preferred type of pasta, making sure to stir it gently to avoid tangling.</li>
                    <li>Cook the pasta until it reaches the right consistency, which is usually when it still has a bit of firmness in the middle, after around 8-12 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While you're waiting for the pasta to cook, heat some olive oil in a big frying pan over medium heat, then add your chosen ingredients for the sauce, such as minced garlic, chopped onions, and sliced tomatoes.</li>
                    <li>AOnce the pasta is ready, drain the water and add the pasta to the frying pan with the sauce, mixing everything together until the pasta is evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Finally, serve the pasta hot, adding some grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves on top if you like.</li>
                </ol>
